## What is it?

Small [scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh/) bucket for miscellaneous bits and bobs. Made for personal use, but feel [free to use it](https://unlicense.org/) if you want.

To add this bucket, run `scoop bucket add dipper https://github.com/onsamyj/dipper`.

To install specific apps, run `scoop install <name-of-an-app>`. Or, to be more robust, `scoop install dipper/<name-of-an-app>`.

## Whatâ€™s in it?

[Boop](https://github.com/miltoncandelero/Boop) â€” Remote installer for Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch. *If you know what I mean.* Run `scoop install boop` to install.

[Espanso](https://espanso.org) â€” text expander. It is in official buckets, but, for some reason, not the latest version. Until they fix that, this is it. Run `scoop install dipper/espanso` to install. Using `dipper/espanso` means that would be installed version from this bucket specifically.

[Sayo Device](https://sayodevice.com/help/std/en/web-device/) â€” configuration program for Sayo mechanical keyboards (can be named differently, look [kinda like this](images/sayodevice.jpg)). Run `scoop install sayodevice` to install.

[Windows Terminal Icons](https://github.com/onsamyj/WindowsTerminalIcons) â€” Icons I made for use with with [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal). Run `scoop install windowsterminalicons` to install. Then add icons to `settings.json`, something like this: `"icon": "C:\\Users\\<yourUsername>\\scoop\\apps\\windowsterminalicons\\current\\PowerShell.png"`

[YeeManage](https://github.com/mdjx/YeeManage) â€” command line tool for controlling Yeelight colour smart globes. Run `scoop install yeemanage` to install.
